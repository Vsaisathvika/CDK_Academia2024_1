# Flutter Chat UI Module

## Description

A basic multi-screen Flutter application that simulates a chat/messaging interface.  
This project demonstrates key Flutter concepts such as screen navigation, widget reuse, layout structuring, and interactive UI.  
It includes three primary screens:

- **ChatListScreen** – Displays a scrollable list of chat contacts or conversation previews.
- **ChatScreen** – Shows detailed chat messages in a bubble-style UI.
- **EmailScreen** – Represents a simulated email view for extended or alternate communication.
